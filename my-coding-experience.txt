My first week of coding was like entering a totally new realm. Everything seemed like a secret code - all these symbols and commands felt like a different language.

I started by learning the absolute basics, trying to understand how code works. It was a mix of feeling super excited when I managed to make something simple happen, like getting text to show up, and feeling a bit overwhelmed because there was so much to learn.

Mistakes were a big part of it all. I'd write some code, hit a button, and then errors would pop up everywhere! Fixing those mistakes became a big part of what I was doing.

Learning all those new terms and ideas was tough. Things like html and css were like learning new words in a foreign language. But slowly, I started to get the hang of it. It was a relief when something I couldnâ€™t understand at first suddenly made sense.

Getting help was a game-changer. I checked out forums and online groups where people shared tips and solutions. Finding someone who went through the same problems and had answers was a huge relief.

Thinking back, it has been a real rollercoaster. It was a mix of feeling lost and excited to keep going. Even though I know I am just getting started, I am eager to keep learning and exploring more about coding.
